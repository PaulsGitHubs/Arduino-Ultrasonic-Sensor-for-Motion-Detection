# Arduino-Ultrasonic-Sensor-for-Motion-Detection
Had some fun developing a motion detector to alert me of any intruder in my house when I am away.
## I added in a simple example code for how you can achieve this - it works as is but you will need to adapt for your setup (ESP for wifi connection and sms sending, etc). 
## Contact me if you need help or have questions.

# It is supposed to send an sms alert to my phone when it detects variations in distance recorded.
There are multiple ways of building out this project:
- arduion uno and esp8622 and ultrasonic detector (could would be same but adapted to setup)
- beagle board and ultrasonic detector (code would be different)
- raspberry pi with familliar components (code would be written in python)

# Places to place to detect unwanted motion
- door
- window
- balcony
- etc
